``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are
user/order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour
.There are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some
numeric codes.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r

  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle), 
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)

  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point()+

“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables

\#\#Problem 2

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r

This final dataset contains 50400 rows and 6 columns. Observations in
the experiments are the activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day
starting at midnight for five week. There are 1440 activity counts in
total.

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accelerometer %>%
  group_by(week,day)%>%
  summarise( total_activity_each_day = sum(activity, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = total_activity_each_day
  )%>%
knitr::kable()
```

From the table we can see this individual does bot have a stable
activity habit. There is no apparent tends. But we can see n Wednesday,
the person has a relatively stable activity but on Sunday, the activity
counts each minute are keeping decreasing.

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
accelerometer %>% 
  group_by(day_id,day, week) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = min,
             y = activity,
             color = day,
             group = day_id))+

From the graph, we can tell that 63 year-old male with BMI 25 usually
does activities during the time from around 8 am to 10 pm. Also, he less
active during the weekends.

\#\#Problem 3

Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly
observed values? Why?

the graph, we can learned that the temperature keeps relatively stable
throughout the 30 years. There was only 2 times that the lowest
temperature were below the -10 C and the highest temperature were around
the 30 C. For the out liner, we can see some of them fro the graph, but
the number of them was very small.

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
